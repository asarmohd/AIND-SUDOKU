# Solve Sudoku with AI

## Synopsis

In this project, students will extend the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve _diagonal_ Sudoku puzzles. A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).

## Instructions

Follow the instructions in the classroom lesson to install and configure the AIND [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) environment. That environment includes several important packages that are used for the project. 

**YOU ONLY NEED TO WRITE CODE IN `solution.py`.**


## Quickstart Guide

### Run the code & visualization

    `(aind)$ python solution.py`

### Run the local test suite

    `(aind)$ python -m unittest -v`

### Run the remote test suite & submit the project

    `(aind)$ udacity submit`


## Coding

You must complete the required functions in the 'solution.py' file (copy in code from the classroom where indicated, and add or extend with new code as described below). The `test_solution.py` file includes a few unit tests for local testing (See the unittest module for information on getting started.), but the primary mechanism for testing your code is the Udacity Project Assistant command line utility described in the next section.

YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO MODIFY OR WRITE YOUR OWN UNIT TESTS AS PART OF COMPLETING THIS PROJECT. The Project Assistant test suite is not shared with students. Writing your own tests leads to a deeper understanding of the project.

1. Run the following command from inside the project folder in your terminal to verify that your system is properly configured for the project. You should see feedback in the terminal about failed test cases -- which makes sense because you haven't implemented any code yet. You will reuse this command later to execute your **local** test cases.

    `$ python -m unittest -v`



## Visualization

**Note:** The `pygame` library is required to visualize your solution -- however, the `pygame` module can be troublesome to install and configure. It should be installed by default with the AIND conda environment, but it is not reliable across all operating systems or versions. Please refer to the pygame documentation [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml), or discuss among your peers in the slack group or discussion forum if you need help.

Running `python solution.py` will automatically attempt to visualize your solution, but you mustuse the provided `assign_value` function (defined in `utils.py`) to track the puzzle solution progress for reconstruction during visuzalization.
